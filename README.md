This is the part of math course to compliment for the shortage of due to my lack of math to study AI better \\

1. basic vector concept: **Dot product** and **Cross product**:

    a. Dot porduct: we have two vector A, B, 

     The Dot product of both vector:  $A \cdot B = |A| \cdot |B| cos(\theta)$

     In physics, it is used to represent **WORK** 

     Dot product is to calculate the project from vector A to vector B （A向量在B的投影）, which is $Proj_{B}A = |A| cos (\theta )$
    b. Cross Product: we have two vector A, B,

     The Cross product of both vector: $A \cdot B = |A| \cdot |B| sin(\theta)$

     which is always used in calculating the area of a rectangle

Example: A (1, 2, 3), B(3, 4, 5), C(2, 4, 7), Caclculate the area of rectangle: 
$$\vec{AB} = (2, 2, 2), \vec{AC} = (1, 2, 4)$$, then the cross product is：
